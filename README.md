# [W.Ware] Proposal

## What is [W.Ware]?

Brief description of the game:
This is a game inspired by WarioWare, a series of comedy-based party games published by Nintendo and featuring Wario. For this particular game, I don't own the rights to Wario, so this is just a game inspired by the overall concept.

The game focus on a series of fast paced, simple to play, minigames which will test your reaction, but will leave you charmed by comedy and joy in playing it. 

This project will be more intricate based on time available.
Low Goal: Create 1 minigame
Mid Goal: Create 2 minigames which alternate upon completion until you "lose"
High Goal: Create 3 minigames

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

minigame(name, id) will be used to create each mini game, which will obviously each have a name, but also an id to randomly flip through them as you go along. 


## Initial thoughts on game structure

I think the most difficult part will be, effectively alternating between games upon completing one. It's almost like creating a slideshow, only instead of pictures, it's interaction.

## Phases of Completion
Need:
1. Game Window (Start button)
2. Minigame(s) (obv)
3. Timer (Seconds reducing per mini game, timer gets shorter upon player succession btw challenges)
4. Scoreboard (Counts number of successful wins)
5. Lose screen and chance to "Play Again"
If time permits:
6. Maybe background music when games start 
7. Music Swapped with more suspensful tracks upon higher scores
